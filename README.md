# Typo

Typo aims to increase your typing speed by focusing on low-speed, high-variance letter combinations.

## Text generation

Typo generates pronouncable text that disproportionately includes letter combinations on which your typing speed is either low or has high variance.

## Statistics

Typo gathers information about your typing habits, such as raw speed and variance. It does so for entire typing sessions, as well as for all 2-grams and the most common 3-grams.

## Settings

### Practice modes:

#### Speed

Generates text that disproportionately contains letter combinations on which your typing speed is relatively slow.

#### Variance

Generates text that disproportionately contains letter combinations on which your typing speed has relatively high variance.

#### Speed+Variance

Generates text that disproportionately contains letter combinations on which your typing speed is either relatively slow or has relatively high variance.

### Text generation

You can customize how frequently difficult letter combinations occur in the generated text.

By default, letter combinations are included using a weighted consideration of both the relative speed/variance and the relative frequency in normal text. You can change this weighting to more or less aggressively include hard letter combinations.
